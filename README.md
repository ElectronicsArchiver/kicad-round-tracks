# KiCad Round Tracks

*A subdivision / native arc-based track rounding plugin for* ***KiCad***

<br>

![Showcase]

## Goal

The goal is to algorithmically melt a **PCB** design, <br>
smoothing all tracks in a predictable manner. 

## Teardrop Plugin

For best results possible, consider using it<br>
in conjunction with this **[Teardrop Plugin]**.

#### Note

Currently, the teardrop plugin has not <br>
been ported fully ported to KiCad 6.

I've fixed the behavior with native arcs <br>
on **[My Fork][Mitxela Teardrop]** of it which should hopefully <br>
be merged in soon.

I have written extensively about my KiCad <br>
melting experiments **[Here][Melting A]** and over **[Here][Melting B]**.

## Use

***For the KiCad 5 compatible version, please use the [kicad-5] branch.***

The intended use is to have:

- A source PCB file, which is easy to edit
- A rendered output file, generated by this plugin

After running **DRC** on the output, you <br>
can then go back and adjust the original <br>
file before running the plugin again.

#### Selection

If you select part of the board, only <br>
the selected tracks will get melted.

*If nothing is selected, the whole file will be processed.*

#### `Create A New File`

Does not immediately write anything to disk, <br>
it merely appends `-rounded` to the filename <br>
so that the next time you hit <kbd> Save </kbd> it won't <br>
overwrite the original.

#### `Use Native`

If this option is ticked, the rounded sections are <br>
implemented using KiCad 6's native PCB arcs.

These _can_ be adjusted after the script has run, <br>
but I still recommend keeping the unrounded <br>
source PCB file.

I have tried hard to ensure that the output <br>
PCB is the same, regardless of if native or <br>
subdivision-based arcs are used.

If the option is ticked, the number <br>
of passes parameter is ignored.

Otherwise, the curves are generated<br>
from many small straight sections.

`2` *or* `3` *passes is usually sufficient.*

There is no loading bar, so if the design is <br>
complicated the interface might freeze for <br>
a few seconds while it runs.

You can set the number of passes to be 1, <br>
and run the plugin repeatedly, and it will <br>
give the same results, while letting you <br>
inspect the intermediate stages.


#### `Radius`

This option is the maximum radius <br>
a curve will have on a `90°` bend.

A smaller curve will be used if the <br>
tracks are shorter, or if the angle <br>
between them is sharper.

The resulting curves will always pass through <br>
at least one point of the original tracks.

Thus individual curves can be controlled by <br>
splitting tracks into smaller sections.

If a curve has too large a radius, placing <br>
a small `45°` bend will make it smaller.

Similarly, if a bigger radius is needed for <br>
certain tracks, you can draw an approximate <br>
curve with free-angle tracks to achieve this.

## Todo
- Limit minimum angle between tracks, to avoid unnecessary subdivisions
- In KiCad 6, the undo history state is broken when the plugin runs. A single tap of Ctrl+Z should undo the rounding.

## Installation
Now available from the Plugin and Content manager.

For manual install, clone or unzip this repository in a KiCad plugin folder. You can list the exact paths where KiCad will search for plugins by opening the scripting console in pcbnew and running:
```
import pcbnew
print(pcbnew.GetWizardsSearchPaths())
```

Under Preferences / Preferences / PCB Editor / Action Plugins, you can choose whether to have a button on the toolbar for quick access to the plugin.

## History
This plugin is based on [flexRoundingSuite] by Julian Loiacono and [kicad-round-tracks][KiCad Round Tracks] by Antoine Pintout. My contribution updated the algorithm so that subdivisions are applied equally, resulting in smoother tracks with fewer clearance errors.
